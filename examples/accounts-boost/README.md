# accounts-boost examples

Includes two two examples of using `@accounts/boost`.

`yarn start:mono` - Starts a GraphQL server which consumes the `@accounts/boost` typeDefs and resolvers when building your app's schema.

`yarn start:micro` - Starts a `@accounts/boost` as a GraphQL micro service which is then stitched with your app's schema.
