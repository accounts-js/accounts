## Note

This package, along with the rest of the packages under the `js-accounts` organization are under active development and are **not** ready for consumption.

## Getting Started

Install the core package.

```
npm i -S @accounts/server
```

Next install the package based on the the type of transport and the web framework you are using. We support GraphQL and REST for the transport and Express.

```
npm i -S @accounts/rest-express
```

Finally you'll need a data store adapter. We support the following data stores.

- [x] [Mongo](https://github.com/js-accounts/mongo)
- [x] [Redis](https://github.com/js-accounts/redis)
- [ ] [SQL](https://github.com/js-accounts/sql) with [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/)

```
npm i -S @accounts/mongo
npm i -S @accounts/redis
npm i -S @accounts/sql
```

## Example

You can find a working example [here](https://github.com/js-accounts/rest-example).
